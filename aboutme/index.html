    <h2> Grant Steere</h2>
    <p> Hello.  My name is Grant.  I've been a student here at BYUI for about a year now.  I decided I wanted to become a software engineer, so I look forward to this class and all it has to offer!  I am nineteen years old, and married.  I know, very young and what not but when you know you know!  Computers have always been an interest of mine since I was a kid, so being able to pursue this field is a dream come true.  I am originally from Southern California, and moved here on campus for school.  Though, due to some unfortunate circumstances I won't be able to stay on campus.  My wife and I are planning to move to Utah in the coming weeks.  Thanks for taking the time to read, and I hope we all can get through this class together!</p>
